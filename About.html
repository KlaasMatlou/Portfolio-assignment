            <big>Hi!</big>, I'm Klaas Matlou, a newby in webdevelopment. In my first 30days of  learning with Power Lean Project "<a href="https://academy.powerlearnprojectafrica.org">https://academy.powerlearnprojectafrica.org</a>", I have already mastered how to work with HTML,
            and a little bit of CSS, Python and DATABASE design and programming with SQL. 
            I Have National N Diploma in Civil Engineering from Capricon TVET college. 
            From an early age i always wanted to become a webdeveloper, but because of financial constraints,
            the dream was put on hold. Luckily PLP has granted me the  chance of becoming a certified webdeveloper. 
            My drive comes from seeing people satisfied with my job.<br>

            My work experience: I worked as Project Manager Intern at Department of COGHSTA for 2years, Our main duty besides everything was to Inspect the government Subsidy houses. prior to that I worked at Makhudu Wildlife reserve as a general worker.
            Currently i am working as a Plant Operator at RTMR, mining industry. I am a versatile person, who's always eager to Learn. But with this Software Engineering and webdevelopment courses, i feel like I have arrived at my destination.

                <p>
                    This Image gallery is a simple example of what one can do with expanding cards, its a stepping stone towards a much biger project, but for now, it demonstrates, the basic concept.
                    The gallery was created Using HTML,CSS, and javaScript.

                <li><a href="https://github.com/KlaasMatlou/Restuarant-Menu">Restuarant-Menu</a>
                <p>
                    This is a menu for a Kasi Restuarant from where i reside. I made this for the owner, The menu features a diverse range of traditional African kasi dishes. 
                    the good thing about it is people can now order from their comfort of their home.

                <h5>Interests</h5>
                <p>I am always excited about the possibilities of what we can archieve with technology.
                    its amazing to see how it can connect people, solve problems, and even spark Joy and fullfilemnt.
                    I am particularly interested in NLP. I like how we can use it to build tools that help people communicate 
                    and learn more effectively.<br><br>

                    I am very fascinated by what computers can do besides playing games, which is one of my others on the To-do list"BUILD A GAME LIKE COD". 
                    According to me, every country in Africa must make webdevelopment a compulsory subject from primary school upto University level.
                    Where the world is heading, Businesses that are making the most of advances in tech are also in a good place to make the most in terms of return on their investments.
                    Tech must be the new Home language for all in Africa.
